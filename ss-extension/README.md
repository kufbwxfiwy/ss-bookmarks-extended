## SS Bookmarks Extended Firefox Extension

You can install this Firefox browser extension either by using the
'Debug Add-ons' feature in your browser and using the files found in
directory SSBookmarksExtended_Files here or else by choosing 'Install
Add-on From File' and trying to install 'SSBookmarksExtended+fx.xpi'.
This latter method will give a warning (assuming your browser settings
allow unverified extensions) saying that it has not been verified. At
this point you can choose 'Install' (anyway).

Note that some features of this extension work in the background using
a background process. Therefore some results (such as bookmark upload)
may not be immidiately apparent. Furthermore if the browser is closed,
these background processes are interrupted. (Therefore more work in
this regard will (hopefully) be done.)

I can never thank enough SS Bookmarks' original author.
